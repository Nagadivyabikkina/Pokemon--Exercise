Need to calculate price of different pokemons purchased in a toy store with applied discounts. 

For example:

# NUMBER OF DIFFERENT POKEMON PURCHASED   DISCOUNT   AMOUNT
            1                               No discount
            2                                   10%
            3                                   20%
            
#  POKEMON   FOR   SALE     PRICE
    Pikachu                 6$
    Squirtle                5$
    Charmander              5$
  
So, A program is written in such a way that all the test cases are verified based on different inputs.
